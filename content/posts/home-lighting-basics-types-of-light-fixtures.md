# Home Lighting Basics: Types of Light Fixtures

Choosing the right light fixtures can make or break your home's atmosphere. Whether you're renovating or just wanting to understand your options better, this guide will walk you through the essential types of light fixtures you'll encounter in home design.

## Ceiling-Mounted Fixtures

### Chandeliers
Not just for fancy dining rooms anymore! Modern chandeliers come in all styles, from classic crystal to industrial-modern. They work best in:
- Entryways with high ceilings
- Dining rooms
- Master bedrooms
- Large living rooms

Remember: The bottom of your chandelier should hang about 30-36 inches above a table, or 7 feet above the floor in open spaces.

### Flush Mounts
These practical fixtures sit directly against the ceiling, perfect for:
- Hallways
- Bedrooms
- Low-ceiling spaces
- Closets

Pro tip: Look for flush mounts with diffusers to avoid harsh direct light.

### Semi-Flush Mounts
A happy medium between chandeliers and flush mounts, these hang down just a bit from the ceiling. They're great for:
- Living rooms
- Kitchens
- Home offices
- Rooms with 8-10 foot ceilings

## Wall-Mounted Fixtures

### Sconces
These versatile fixtures can transform any wall. Use them for:
- Framing bathroom mirrors
- Hallway lighting
- Bedside reading lights
- Accent lighting in living spaces

Installation tip: Mount sconces at eye level (about 5.5-6 feet high) to avoid glare.

### Picture Lights
Specifically designed to illuminate artwork or photographs, these create gallery-like effects in your home.

## Floor Lighting

### Floor Lamps
The most flexible lighting option you can own. Look for:
- Adjustable heights
- Swing arms for reading
- Heavy bases for stability
- Multiple light settings

### Torchiere Lamps
These upward-facing floor lamps bounce light off the ceiling for soft, ambient lighting. Perfect for:
- Dark corners
- Small apartments
- Reading nooks
- Living room ambiance

## Table Lighting

### Table Lamps
The workhorses of home lighting. Use them for:
- Bedside tables
- Living room end tables
- Home office desks
- Console tables

Size tip: Your table lamp should be about 1.5 times the height of whatever it's sitting on.

### Desk Lamps
Task lighting champions, essential for:
- Home offices
- Craft areas
- Reading nooks
- Study spaces

## Practical Considerations

### Bulb Types
Most fixtures now work with:
- LED bulbs (most energy-efficient)
- CFL bulbs
- Traditional incandescent (being phased out)
- Halogen bulbs

### Light Temperature
Remember these basic guidelines:
- Warm white (2700-3000K): Living spaces, bedrooms
- Cool white (3500-4100K): Kitchens, bathrooms
- Daylight (5000-6500K): Home offices, craft rooms

## Making Your Choice

When selecting fixtures, consider:
- Room size and ceiling height
- Natural light availability
- Your home's style
- Your lighting needs (task, ambient, or accent)
- Energy efficiency
- Maintenance requirements

Remember: The best lighting plan usually combines several types of fixtures to create layers of light. Don't be afraid to mix and match!
